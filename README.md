<h2> Our Project: </h2>
<p> This program allows you to do various mathematical calculations, such as basic arithmatic, prime factorization, base change, solving polynomials, adding polynomials, and taking derivatives. </p>
<h2> Working Features </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Can do basic arithmetic </li>
  <li> Can find the prime factorization of positive numbers</li>
  <li> Can find convert from base to base as long as bases are between 2 and 10</li>
  <li> Can take the derivative of any single variable function without trigonometry, e, or log</li>
  <li> Can add and subtract polynomials</li>
</ul>
<h2> Unresolved Bugs </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Everything assumes that the input is appropriate for the command as detailed below </li>
  <li> The various methods do not check for undefined input (like dividing by 0) or if operations are followed by a number </li>
  <li> The various methods do not return fully simplified expression sometimes</li>
  <li> Arithmetic does not support things like ()</li>
  <li> Prime factorization does not work (nicely) for numbers larger than 10^9 and only works for integers</li>
  <li> Converting the base only does bases between 2 and 10</li>
  <li> Derivatives does not include trigonometry, e, or log</li>
  <li> The powers for the polynomials cannot be above 9</li>
  <li> For polynomials everything has to be filled out including "+0" or "+0x" etc.</li>
  <li> For polynomials the powers of the two polynomials have to be the same (if the highest power of one is x^2 the other must be as well)</li>
</ul>

<h2> Directions on how to use: </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Type in which ever of the following features you would like to use:
       <ul>
	 <li>prime factorize [integer] for example: prime factorize 18</li>
 	 <li>add (or subtract) poly [polynomial] [polynomial] for example: add 3x^2+2x^1+9 5x^2+8x^1+6</li>
 	 <li>convert base [current base] [end base] [number to convert] for example: convert base 10 2 14</li>
 	 <li>arithmetic [expression] for example: arithmetic 3 * 4 + 1</li>
      	 <li>derivative of [polynomial] for example: derivative of 5x^2</li>
       </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Press enter to get the result (button or keyboard doesn't matter)</li>
