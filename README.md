# Wolfram Alpha
## By: Matcha Tea (Masha Zorin and JT Tao)

Our final project is a Java "computational knowledge engine" similar to Wolfram Alpha (although far less featured). It's basically a giant calculator that can interpret user input, find the correct function to use and compute the correct answer. 

Currently our program can:
- Elementary Mathematics
  - do basic arithmetic
  - find square roots*
  - do arithmetic on fractions*
  - convert fractions to percentages*
  - calculate the percentage of a quantity*
  - show place values of a number*
- Numbers
  - compute the prime factorization of a number
  - compute the exact value of a repeating decimal**
  - do basic arithmetic on complex numbers**
  - find roots of complex numbers***
  - convert a number in a given base to another one
- Algebra
  - solve a polynomial equation***
  - factor a polynomial equation***
  - do basic arithmetic on matrices**
  - find the domain of a function**
- Calculus
  - compute an indefinite integral*****
  - compute a definite integral****
  - calculate the derivative of a function****
