<h2> Our Project: </h2>
<p> This program allows you to do various mathematical calculations, such as basic arithmatic, prime factorization, base change, solving polynomials, adding polynomials, and taking derivatives. </p>
<h2> Working Features </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Can do basic arithmatic </li>
  <li> Can find the prime factorization of positive numbers</li>
  <li> Can find convert from base to base as long as bases are between 2 and 10</li>
  <li> Can take the derivative of any single variable function without trigonometry, e, or log</li>
  <li> Can add polynomials</li>
  <li> Can solve polynomials</li>
</ul>
<h2> Unresolved Bugs </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Derivative method does not check for undefined input (like dividing by 0) or if operations are followed by a number </li>
  <li> Derivative method does not return fully simplified expression sometimes</li>
  <li> Base converter does not check for bad input</li>
  <li> </li>

<h2> Directions on how to use: </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Type in which ever of the following features you would like to use:
       <ul>
	 <li>Prime factorize </li>
 	 <li>Add poly </li>
 	 <li>Convert base </li>
 	 <li> </li>
      	 <li> </li>
      	 <li> </li>
       </ul>
       </li>
  <li> Then type in your input - for most features what this should be is clear, for convert poly, input the base you are converting from, a space, the base you are converting to, a space, and the number you are converting</li>
  <li> Press enter to get the result</li>
</ol>
